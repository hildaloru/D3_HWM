          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age and Income</h3>
          <p>Health risks reduce with increased income and education in general.</p>

          <p>Health risks  like obesity increases in the middle age  but can be minimized with good health behaviours.
            Income inequality has grown substantially in recent decades, which may perpetuate 
            or exacerbate health disparities.</p>

          <p>Policy initiatives that supplement income and improve educational opportunities, 
            housing prospects, and social mobility—particularly in childhood—can reduce 
            poverty and lead to downstream health effects not only for low-income people but 
            also for those in the middle class.</p>

            <p>Economic inequality is increasingly linked to disparities in life expectancy 
              across the income distribution, and these disparities seem to be growing 
              over time. In the 1970s, a sixty-year-old man in the top half of the income 
              distribution could expect to live 1.2 years longer than a man in the bottom half. 
              By the turn of the century, he could expect to live 5.8 years longer.</p>

              <p>A landmark study by Raj Chetty and colleagues found that since 2001, 
              life expectancy has increased by about 2.5 years for the top 5 percent of the 
              income distribution, but there have been no gains for those in the bottom 5 percent. 
              Men in the top 1 percent of the income distribution can now expect to live fifteen years 
              longer than those in the bottom 1 percent. For women, the difference is about ten 
              years—an effect equivalent to that of a lifetime of smoking.</p>
